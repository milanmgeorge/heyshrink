      <p>
        People often keep it a secret, but the urge to self-harm isn’t uncommon,
        especially in adolescents and young adults. Many overcome it with
        treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether a person has recently started hurting themself or has been doing
        it for a while, there is an opportunity to improve health and reduce
        behaviors. Talking to a doctor or a trusted friend or family member is
        the first step towards understanding your behavior and finding relief.
      </p>
      <p>
        Self-harm or self-injury means hurting yourself on purpose. One common
        method is cutting with a sharp object. But any time someone deliberately
        hurts themself is classified as self-harm. Some people feel an impulse
        to cause burns, pull out hair or pick at wounds to prevent healing.
        Extreme injuries can result in broken bones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hurting yourself—or thinking about hurting yourself—is a sign of
        emotional distress. These uncomfortable emotions may grow more intense
        if a person continues to use self-harm as a coping mechanism. Learning
        other ways to tolerate the mental pain will make you stronger in the
        long term.
      </p>
      <p>
        Self-harm also causes feelings of shame. The scars caused by frequent
        cutting or burning can be permanent. Drinking alcohol or doing drugs
        while hurting yourself increases the risk of a more severe injury than
        intended. And it takes time and energy away from other things you value.
        Skipping classes to change bandages or avoiding social occasions to
        prevent people from seeing your scars is a sign that your habit is
        negatively affecting work and relationships.
      </p>
      <h2 class="illnesscap">Why People Self-Harm</h2>
      <p>
        Self-harm is not a mental illness, but a behavior that indicates a need
        for better coping skills. Several illnesses are associated with it,
        including borderline personality disorder, depression, eating disorders,
        anxiety or posttraumatic distress disorder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Self-harm occurs most often during the teenage and young adult years,
        though it can also happen later in life. Those at the most risk are
        people who have experienced trauma, neglect or abuse. For instance, if a
        person grew up in an unstable family, it might have become a coping
        mechanism. If a person binge drinks or uses illicit drugs, they are at
        greater risk of self-injury, because alcohol and drugs lower
        self-control.
      </p>
      <p>
        The urge to hurt yourself may start with overwhelming anger, frustration
        or pain. When a person is not sure how to deal with emotions, or learned
        as a child to hide emotions, self-harm may feel like a release.
        Sometimes, injuring yourself stimulates the body’s endorphins or
        pain-killing hormones, thus raising their mood. Or if a person doesn’t
        feel many emotions, they might cause themself pain in order to feel
        something “real” to replace emotional numbness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a person injures themself, they may experience shame and guilt. If
        the shame leads to intense negative feelings, that person may hurt
        themself again. The behavior can thus become a dangerous cycle and a
        long-time habit. Some people even create rituals around it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Self-harm isn’t the same as attempting suicide. However, it is a symptom
        of emotional pain that should be taken seriously. If someone is hurting
        themself, they may be at an increased risk of feeling suicidal. It’s
        important to find treatment for the underlying emotions.
      </p>
      <h2 class="illnesscap">Treatment And Coping</h2>
      <p>
        There are effective treatments for self-harm that can allow a person to
        feel in control again. Psychotherapy is important to any treatment plan.
        Self-harm may feel necessary to manage emotions, so a person will need
        to learn new coping mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first step in getting help is talking to a trusted adult, friend or
        medical professional who is familiar with the subject, ideally a
        psychiatrist. A psychiatrist will ask that person questions about their
        health, life history and any injurious behaviors in the past and
        present. This conversation, called a diagnostic interview, may last an
        hour or more. Doctors can’t use blood tests or physical exams to
        diagnose mental illness, so they rely on detailed information from the
        individual. The more information that person can give, the better the
        treatment plan will be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on any underlying illness, a doctor may prescribe medication
        to help with difficult emotions. For someone with depression, for
        instance, an antidepressant may lessen harmful urges.
      </p>
      <p>
        A doctor will also recommend therapy to help a person learn new
        behaviors, if self-injury has become a habit. Several different kinds of
        therapy can help, depending on the diagnosis.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong> Psychodynamic therapy</strong> focuses on exploring past
          experiences and emotions
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Cognitive behavioral therapy</strong> focuses on recognizing
          negative thought patterns and increasing coping skills
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Dialectical behavioral therapy</strong> can help a person
          learn positive coping methods
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If your symptoms are overwhelming or severe, your doctor may recommend a
        short stay in a psychiatric hospital. A hospital offers a safe
        environment where you can focus your energy on treatment.
      </p>

      <h2 class="illnesscap">What To Do When Someone Self-Harms</h2>
      <p>
        Perhaps you have noticed a friend or family member with frequent bruises
        or bandages. If someone is wearing long sleeves and pants even in hot
        weather, they may be trying to hide injuries or scarring.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that this is a behavior that might be part of a larger
        condition and there may be additional signs of emotional distress. They
        might make statements that sound hopeless or worthless, have poor
        impulse control, or have difficulty getting along with others.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re worried a family member or friend might be hurting themself,
        ask them how they're doing and be prepared to listen to the answer, even
        if it makes you uncomfortable. This may be a hard subject to understand.
        One of the best things is to tell them that while you may not fully
        understand, you’ll be there to help. Don’t dismiss emotions or try to
        turn it into a joke.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gently encourage someone to get treatment by stating that self-harm
        isn’t uncommon and doctors and therapists can help. If possible, offer
        to help find treatment. But don’t go on the offensive and don’t try to
        make the person promise to stop, as it takes more than willpower to
        quit.
