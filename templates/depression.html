      <p>
        Depression is a common and serious medical illness that negatively
        affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it
        is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss
        of interest in activities you once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of
        emotional and physical problems and can decrease your ability to
        function at work and at home.
      </p>

      <p>Depression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Feeling sad or having a depressed mood</li>
        <li>Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed</li>
        <li>Changes in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting</li>
        <li>Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much</li>
        <li>Loss of energy or increased fatigue</li>
        <li>
          Increase in purposeless physical activity (e.g., inability to sit
          still, pacing, handwringing) or slowed movements or speech (these
          actions must be severe enough to be observable by others)
        </li>
        <li>Feeling worthless or guilty</li>
        <li>Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions</li>
        <li>Thoughts of death or suicide</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Symptoms must last at least two weeks and must represent a change in
        your previous level of functioning for a diagnosis of depression.Also,
        medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin
        deficiency) can mimic symptoms of depression so it is important to rule
        out general medical causes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given
        year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some
        time in their life. Depression can occur at any time, but on average,
        first appears during the late teens to mid-20s. Women are more likely
        than men to experience depression. Some studies show that one-third of
        women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime.
        There is a high degree of heritability (approximately 40%) when
        first-degree relatives (parents/children/siblings) have depression.
      </p>
      <h2 class="illnesscap">
        Depression Is Different From Sadness or Grief/Bereavement
      </h2>
      <p>
        The death of a loved one, loss of a job or the ending of a relationship
        are difficult experiences for a person to endure. It is normal for
        feelings of sadness or grief to develop in response to such situations.
        Those experiencing loss often might describe themselves as being
        “depressed.”
      </p>
      <p>
        But being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process
        is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same
        features of depression. Both grief and depression may involve intense
        sadness and withdrawal from usual activities. They are also different in
        important ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In grief, painful feelings come in waves, often intermixed with
          positive memories of the deceased. In major depression, mood and/or
          interest (pleasure) are decreased for most of two weeks.
        </li>
        <li>
          In grief, self-esteem is usually maintained. In major depression,
          feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common.
        </li>
        <li>
          In grief, thoughts of death may surface when thinking of or
          fantasizing about “joining” the deceased loved one. In major
          depression, thoughts are focused on ending one’s life due to feeling
          worthless or undeserving of living or being unable to cope with the
          pain of depression.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Grief and depression can co-exist For some people, the death of a loved
        one, losing a job or being a victim of a physical assault or a major
        disaster can lead to depression. When grief and depression co-occur, the
        grief is more severe and lasts longer than grief without depression.
        Distinguishing between grief and depression is important and can assist
        people in getting the help, support or treatment they need.
      </p>
      <h2 class="illnesscap">Risk Factors for Depression</h2>
      <p>
        Depression can affect anyone, even a person who appears to live in
        relatively ideal circumstances. Several factors can play a role in
        depression:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Biochemistry:</strong> Differences in certain chemicals in the
          brain may contribute to symptoms of depression.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Genetics:</strong> Depression can run in families. For
          example, if one identical twin has depression, the other has a 70
          percent chance of having the illness sometime in life.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Personality:</strong> People with low self-esteem, who are
          easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear
          to be more likely to experience depression.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Environmental factors:</strong> Continuous exposure to
          violence, neglect, abuse or poverty may make some people more
          vulnerable to depression.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="illnesscap">How Is Depression Treated?</h2>
      <p>
        Depression is among the most treatable of mental disorders. Between 80%
        and 90% percent of people with depression eventually respond well to
        treatment. Almost all patients gain some relief from their symptoms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a
        thorough diagnostic evaluation, including an interview and a physical
        examination. In some cases, a blood test might be done to make sure the
        depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid problem or a
        vitamin deficiency (reversing the medical cause would alleviate the
        depression-like symptoms). The evaluation will identify specific
        symptoms and explore medical and family histories as well as cultural
        and environmental factors with the goal of arriving at a diagnosis and
        planning a course of action.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Medication:</strong>Brain chemistry may contribute to an
        individual’s depression and may factor into their treatment. For this
        reason, antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one’s brain
        chemistry. These medications are not sedatives, “uppers” or
        tranquilizers. They are not habit-forming. Generally antidepressant
        medications have no stimulating effect on people not experiencing
        depression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Antidepressants may produce some improvement within the first week or
        two of use yet full benefits may not be seen for two to three months. If
        a patient feels little or no improvement after several weeks, his or her
        psychiatrist can alter the dose of the medication or add or substitute
        another antidepressant. In some situations other psychotropic
        medications may be helpful. It is important to let your doctor know if a
        medication does not work or if you experience side effects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Psychiatrists usually recommend that patients continue to take
        medication for six or more months after the symptoms have improved.
        Longer-term maintenance treatment may be suggested to decrease the risk
        of future episodes for certain people at high risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Psychotherapy:</strong>Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” is
        sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; for moderate to
        severe depression, psychotherapy is often used along with antidepressant
        medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be
        effective in treating depression. CBT is a form of therapy focused on
        the problem solving in the present. CBT helps a person to recognize
        distorted/negative thinking with the goal of changing thoughts and
        behaviors to respond to challenges in a more positive manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Psychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include
        others. For example, family or couples therapy can help address issues
        within these close relationships. Group therapy brings people with
        similar illnesses together in a supportive environment, and can assist
        the participant to learn how others cope in similar situations .
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on the severity of the depression, treatment can take a few
        weeks or much longer. In many cases, significant improvement can be made
        in 10 to 15 sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)</strong>is a medical treatment
        that has been most commonly reserved for patients with severe major
        depression who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a
        brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under
        anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week
        for a total of six to 12 treatments. It is usually managed by a team of
        trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an
        anesthesiologist and a nurse or physician assistant. ECT has been used
        since the 1940s, and many years of research have led to major
        improvements and the recognition of its effectiveness as a mainstream
        rather than a "last resort" treatment.
      </p>
      <h2 class="illnesscap">Self-help and Coping</h2>
      <p>
        There are a number of things people can do to help reduce the symptoms
        of depression. For many people, regular exercise helps create positive
        feeling and improves mood. Getting enough quality sleep on a regular
        basis, eating a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol (a depressant) can
        also help reduce symptoms of depression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depression is a real illness and help is available. With proper
        diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of people with depression
        will overcome it. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, a
        first step is to see your family physician or psychiatrist. Talk about
        your concerns and request a thorough evaluation. This is a start to
        addressing your mental health needs.

      </ul>
      <h2 class="illnesscap">Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder</h2>
      <p>
        Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) was added to the Diagnostic and
        Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) in 2013. A woman with
        PMDD has severe symptoms of depression, irritability, and tension about
        a week before menstruation begins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Common symptoms include mood swings, irritability or anger, depressed
        mood, and marked anxiety or tension. Other symptoms may include
        decreased interest in usual activities, difficulty concentrating, lack
        of energy or easy fatigue, changes in appetite with specific food
        cravings, trouble sleeping or sleeping too much, or a sense of being
        overwhelmed or out of control. Physical symptoms may include breast
        tenderness or swelling, joint or muscle pain, a sensation of “bloating,”
        or weight gain.
      </p>
      <p>
        These symptoms begin a week to 10 days before the start of menstruation
        and improve or stop around the onset of menses. The symptoms lead to
        significant distress and problems with regular functioning or social
        interactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a diagnosis of PMDD, symptoms must have occurred in most of the
        menstrual cycles during the past year and must have an adverse effect on
        work or social functioning. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is estimated
        to affect between 1.8% to 5.8% of menstruating women every year.
      </p>
      <p>
        PMDD can be treated with antidepressants, birth control pills, or
        nutritional supplements. Diet and lifestyle changes, such as reducing
        caffeine and alcohol, getting enough sleep and exercise, and practicing
        relaxations techniques, can help.
      </p>
      <p>
        Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is similar to PMDD in that symptoms occur
        seven to 10 days before a woman’s period begins. However, PMS involves
        fewer and less severe symptoms than PMDD.
      </p>
      <h2 class="illnesscap">Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder</h2>
      <p>
        Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is a condition that occurs in
        children and youth ages 6 to 18. It involves a chronic and severe
        irritability resulting in severe and frequent temper outbursts. The
        temper outbursts can be verbal or can involve behavior such as physical
        aggression toward people or property. These outbursts are significantly
        out of proportion to the situation and are not consistent with the
        child’s developmental age. They must occur frequently (three or more
        times per week on average) and typically in response to frustration. In
        between the outbursts, the child’s mood is persistently irritable or
        angry most of the day, nearly every day. This mood is noticeable by
        others, such as parents, teachers, and peers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order for a diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder to be
        made, symptoms must be present for at least one year in at least two
        settings (such as at home, at school, with peers) and the condition must
        begin before age 10. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is much more
        common in males than females. It may occur along with other disorders,
        including major depressive, attention-deficit/hyperactivity, anxiety,
        and conduct disorders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder can have a significant impact on
        the child’s ability to function and a significant impact on the family.
        Chronic, severe irritability and temper outbursts can disrupt family
        life, make it difficult for the child/youth to make or keep friendships,
        and cause difficulties at school.
      </p>
      <p>
        Treatment typically involves psychotherapy (cognitive behavior therapy)
        and/or medications.
      </p>
      <h2 class="illnesscap">Persistent Depressive Disorder</h2>
      <p>
        A person with persistent depressive disorder (previously referred to as
        dysthymic disorder) has a depressed mood for most of the day, for more
        days than not, for at least two years. In children and adolescents, the
        mood can be irritable or depressed, and must continue for at least one
        year.
      </p>
      <p>In addition to depressed mood, symptoms include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Poor appetite or overeating</li>
        <li>Insomnia or hypersomnia</li>
        <li>Low energy or fatigue</li>
        <li>Low self-esteem</li>
        <li>Poor concentration or difficulty making decisions</li>
        <li>Feelings of hopelessness</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Persistent depressive disorder often begins in childhood, adolescence,
        or early adulthood and affects an estimated 0.5% of adults in the United
        States every year. Individuals with persistent depressive disorder often
        describe their mood as sad or “down in the dumps.” Because these
        symptoms have become a part of the individual’s day-to-day experience,
        they may not seek help, just assuming that “I’ve always been this way.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The symptoms cause significant distress or difficulty in work, social
        activities, or other important areas of functioning. While the impact of
        persistent depressive disorder on work, relationships and daily life can
        vary widely, its effects can be as great as or greater than those of
        major depressive disorder.
      </p>
      <p>
        A major depressive episode may precede the onset of persistent
        depressive disorder but may also arise during (and be superimposed on) a
        previous diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder.
